Alessa tracks activities and transactions across corporate purchases and credit cards to detect anomalies, personal purchases, policy violations and other misuses. Using the sanctions screening module makes possible to conduct on-demand, periodic, or real-time screening to evaluate and remediate risks. Additionally, the regulatory reporting tools enable regulators to auto-populate, validate and electronically submit currency transactions, suspicious activity and suspicious transaction reports.

Thanks to its application programming interface (API), Alessa fully integrates with several third-party solutions, as well as it has the ability to integrate data from disparate IT and business systems.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Regulatory Technology (RegTech)
"RegTech includes any use of technology to match structured and unstructured data to information taxonomies or decision rules that are meaningful to both regulators and the firms they regulate, in order to automate compliance or oversight processes."*

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Major trends in terms of FinTech apply to RegTech. However, it is possible to identify a few of these that have especially impacted the RegTech domain, such as: 

- Cyber Security. Market grown more than 30Xx in 13 years.
  According to Chris Lamoureux "[a] few key events that made international news, highlight these concerns. The NSA surveillance leaked by Edward Snowden, leaked information of millions of people and slow response by Equifax, and the depth of data points that are tracked by Facebook and used by Cambridge Analytica.”
- Enhanced Regulation and Compliance Requirements. Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism have been enhanced globally. Recent scandals from major banks and economies have shown that the system is vulnerable and can be abused by criminals. In this sense, it is reasonable to expect even more strict regulations to be implemented.
  Enhanced requirements may cause an increase in the costs associated with compliance across the traditional financial system, and even for FinTech start-ups. 
  According to Lamoreux indicates that "[o]ne research report predicts that the global RegTech market will grow from $4.3 billion in 2018 to $12.3 billion by 2023, while another report predicted that the spending on RegTech would reach $76bn by 2022." 
- Cloud Computing. In the last decade, as a result of an increased understanding of technology, cloud computing is nowadays trsuted and reliable. Cloud-based solutions have proven to be straight-forward, scalable and cost-efficient.
- Big data and IoT. The amount of data that is being collected has made possible to start working on more sophisticated solutions using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Additionally, connectivity increased considerably thanks to the widespread of the access to internet and the proliferation of smartphones and other gadgets connected to internet.
- Payment methods and financial inclusion. International organizations and governments have made efforts to increase the financial inclusion and to limited cash as a method of payment. Transactions completed in cash are to trace a allow to obscure the origin of the funds. 
In particular, with regards to Canada, "the main difference between 2010 and 2020 is the remarkable transition away from paper-based payments to electronic payments. In total, electronic payments transactions accounted for ~80 per cent of the total payments volume and >~60 per cent of the total payments value. Since the early 2010's, electronic payments volume has captured an additional 18 per cent of the total payments market volume, annually. This can be largely attributed to the increased adoption of emerging payment channels, including contactless, e-commerce and P2P payments, that Canadians find great convenience in."

The abovementioned trends show the areas of opportunity for RegTech in the following year: Cybersecurity, data-driven approached and an enhanced focus on prevention. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
- Risk assessment. While Alessa is an effective solution for complying with regulation, there is room to add a risk assessment feature. Financial institutions must assess their risks, which maybe challenging due to the amount of data required and the required analytical insights. Since Alessa is already analyzing a significant amount of data, it could also consider introducing a comprehensive risk assessment tool. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The tendency and need to reduce costs due to the covid19 pandemic will impact different areas. In this way, risk assessment is a way to strengthen the focus on prevention; therefore, the likelihood of paying fines, abuse of the system, and expensive remedial measures.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Stronger data analysis capabilities for the production of relevant insights. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Due to the amount of the data to analyse.
